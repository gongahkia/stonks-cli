stonks-cli TODOs (philosophy-aligned)
Date: 2026-01-04

Project intent (as implemented today)
- Batteries-included, deterministic-friendly stock analysis CLI.
- Fetches daily OHLCV (default: Stooq), computes heuristic strategy signals + simple risk hints.
- Writes human-readable reports (and optional JSON) to reports/, tracks last run + history.
- Extensible via plugins (strategies + provider factories) and runnable on a schedule.

====================
P0 — Correctness / Reliability

====================
P1 — CLI UX (keep it simple)
====================


====================
P1 — Data + Caching
====================

P1 — Performance (without complexity)
====================


====================
P2 — Analysis + Risk Model Tweaks (still heuristic)
====================
====================
P2 — Reporting
====================

P2 — Scheduler
====================


====================
P2 — Plugins (extensibility as a first-class feature)
====================


====================
P3 — Docs / Packaging / Quality
====================
[ ] Add a minimal CI workflow.
    - Run pytest on push/PR for 3.11–3.13 (or whichever you support).

[ ] Add ruff formatting/linting + (optional) mypy.
    - Goal: keep the CLI stable and refactors safe.

[ ] Add tests for:
    - schedule timezone support
    - JSON report schema fields
    - cache TTL expiry behavior
    - doctor output keys (smoke)

====================
Future ideas (only if they fit the “CLI reports” ethos)
====================
[ ] Add a "watchlist" mode.
    - Manage named ticker sets (stored in config) and run analyze on a set.

[ ] Add a simple "signals diff".
    - Compare latest report vs previous run and highlight changes.

[ ] Add portfolio-aware summary.
    - You already compute an equal-weight portfolio equity; optionally print it in report header.

[ ] Optional interactive TUI could be added later, but keep core non-interactive and scriptable.
