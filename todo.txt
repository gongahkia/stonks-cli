stonks-cli TODOs (philosophy-aligned)
Date: 2026-01-04

Project intent (as implemented today)
- Batteries-included, deterministic-friendly stock analysis CLI.
- Fetches daily OHLCV (default: Stooq), computes heuristic strategy signals + simple risk hints.
- Writes human-readable reports (and optional JSON) to reports/, tracks last run + history.
- Extensible via plugins (strategies + provider factories) and runnable on a schedule.

Future ideas (only if they fit the “CLI reports” ethos)
====================
[ ] Optional interactive TUI could be added later, but keep core non-interactive and scriptable.
